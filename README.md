# Welcome to the Car Rental Website 🚗

Hey there! This is a simple project for a Car Rental Website that I created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It’s designed to let users explore car rental options and register easily. Let me walk you through what’s inside!

# What’s Inside?

**🏠 Homepage (index.html)**

This is the main landing page where users can navigate to different sections of the website.

**📝 Registration Page (registerform.html & registerform.css)**

There’s a sleek form here for users to sign up. It’s styled with its own CSS file to keep things neat and functional.

**✅ Confirmation Page (completed.html)**

After completing a form, users are taken to this success page that confirms everything went through.

**🎯 Interactive Features (main.js)**

I’ve added JavaScript to make the site a bit more dynamic and user-friendly.

**📂 Assets Folder**

All the images and resources for the site are tucked away here to keep things organized.

# Built With
**HTML:** To structure the pages.

**CSS:** For styling and layout.

**JavaScript:** To make it interactive.

# What’s Next?

Here are some ideas I’d love to add in the future:

A backend system for handling user data.

A database to store rental information.

A responsive design for mobile devices.
